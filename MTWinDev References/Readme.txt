Copy your MonoTouch Reference DLLs into this folder to enable the use of the MTWinDev solution.

MTWinDev allows you to edit and compile your MonoTouch game in Visual Studio.
This is useful for checking syntax, but does not output anything useful.
To deploy and debug, you must still use MonoTouch on a Mac.



The files you need are:

OpenTK.dll
System.Core.dll
System.Xml.dll
System.dll
monotouch.dll
mscorlib.dll

(Currently I am building against MonoTouch 3.2.4)
