Clipping to the window is disabled by default in Silverlight. So objects will draw "outside" where you expect if your plugin window is larger than the resolution you set in ExEn/XNA.

You can enable internal clipping by calling `GraphicsDevice.HintClipEnable()` '''(NOT RECOMMENDED)'''

The reason that it is not recommended and is disabled by default is because, if your game uses ''any'' software surfaces, it ''drastically'' reduces performance! See the comments on `HintClipEnable` for details.

The '''recommended''' mechanism for clipping your game's display is to set the size of the Silverlight plugin window, in your HTML, to exactly match the size of your game. ie:

{{{
<object data="data:application/x-silverlight-2," type="application/x-silverlight-2" width="480" height="320">
}}}

(Note: The test page generated by Silverlight in the "bin" directory will be regenerated if you modify it. You have to create your own copy (or use the provided `TestPageDebug.html`). You then have to tell VS to stop using the generated page and use the external one instead. The setting is on the Debug page of the project properties. This is a per-user setting so it's not part of the provided project files.)
