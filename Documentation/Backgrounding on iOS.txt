The `Game` class for iOS has two additional events that you can hook or override:

{{{
public event EventHandler EnterForeground;
protected virtual void OnEnterForeground(object sender, EventArgs args);

public event EventHandler EnterBackground;
protected virtual void OnEnterBackground(object sender, EventArgs args);
}}}

These will notify you if your game is being backgrouneded or foregrounded (iOS multi-tasking).

The `Activated` and `Deactivated` (standard in XNA) events will trigger on incoming calls, alerts, the task-switching bar being displayed, etc.
